# Color Picker

A simple React program that allows users to pick a color and displays the selection in real time. The project uses the built-in HTML color picker and shows the selected color as the background of a preview box.


## Features

- Color Selection: Allows users to choose a color using the built-in HTML color picker. The background of the display box updates dynamically.
- Color Display: Shows the currently selected color as a hexadecimal color code and reflects the color in the background of the display box.
